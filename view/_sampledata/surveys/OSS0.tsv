Several of the questions asked about paid work for contributions to the project; I answered 0 because nobody besides myself has been explicitly paid to work on it, but many have contributed to it under the broad umbrella of their relevant project work, for which they are being paid.

"To sustain the software I have been working as an independent consultant. People hire me to fix bugs, develop new features, or provide training. Most of my clients are academic researchers. I started doing this part-time in 2018 and went full-time in 2019 and it is still going great.

In the past I worked in academia myself, but that was horrible: Non-technical academics always get the credit, way too much bureaucracy to take on a consultancy projects, and no clear career paths for people like me.

We had originally started with an [Anonymised] Enterprise account without realizing that we would never be able to make our repository public, so we created a separate repository through a public account to ensure our materials would be open. When we make changes to our files, we push to both the Enterprise and public accounts, so the two repositories are essentially mirrored. However, we use the Enterprise account for project management - i.e., we post issues, have dev branches, make pull requests, etc., on the Enterprise account, and none of this is seen on the public account. I believe the only way to get access to our Enterprise account would be to have an [Anonymised] email address.

We're working on it because it's related to our research, so we figured it was worth the effort to go beyond just writing research code and make it more general. But it's in no one's job description and will be part of no one's dissertation.

"I had a bit hard time deciding answers to some of the questions, e.g.:
Size of the community AT THE MOMENT: depends on how big window the MOMENT is, and who counts (e.g. professors who contribute by hopefully paying the maintainers, or at least help with funding applications). I inserted medium-concervative estimates. The same for the future.
People paid to maintain: Should e.g. 20% FTE count as 0.2, 0, or 1? Should people who contribute voluntarily but within their paid worktime count? Again, I inserted a medium-conservative estimate."
